# Around The Grounds
  
 
This website has been created for my Interactive Frontend Development Milestone 2 project, the second project on the [Code Institute Diploma in Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/) course.

This project introduces interactivity through the use of JavaScript. The aim is to demonstrate the ability to create a Frontend site which allows users to actively engage with data and alter the way information is displayed in order to achieve their preferred goals.  

'Around The Grounds' provides the locations of the English Premier League football grounds in the London area, displayed using Google Maps. The primary aim is to allow users to locate their desired ground(s), display information about their selected ground(s) and request further information, including tour details, using a Contact form.

## User Experience (UX)

---

This application will follow the principles of User Centred Design (UCD), which will focus on placing users at the centre of the design and development process.
 
This site has two principal user goals to consider.

1.  **Site/Business Owners** - the interests of the site/business owners are twofold. The primary focus is to provide users with information about London Premier League football grounds and encourage them to book official tours to the grounds. The second aim is to work towards creating and expanding a business by impressing the value of the website on football club business operatives, encouraging future partnerships to promote and sell their tours.

2.  **Site Users** - the main focus of the site will be to provide information to users about London Premier League football grounds. It is anticipated that the vast majority of users will already have some interest in football. However, there will be other users with little previous interest in the game who would find the site useful e.g. visitors to London. Either way, it is expected that most users would rely on mobile devices to view the website. I am drawing on the experience of myself and friends as followers of football and users of football related sites to create the user goals for this site.
