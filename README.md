# Around The Grounds
  
 
This website has been created for my Interactive Frontend Development Milestone 2 project, the second project on the [Code Institute Diploma in Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/) course.

This project introduces interactivity through the use of JavaScript. The aim is to demonstrate the ability to create a Frontend site which allows users to actively engage with data and alter the way information is displayed in order to achieve their preferred goals.  

'Around The Grounds' provides the locations of the English Premier League football grounds in the London area, displayed using Google Maps. The primary aim is to allow users to locate their desired ground(s), display information about their selected ground(s) and request further information, including tour details, using a Contact form.

## User Experience (UX)

---

This application will follow the principles of User Centred Design (UCD), which will focus on placing users at the centre of the design and development process.
 
This site has two principal user goals to consider.

1.  **Site/Business Owners** - the interests of the site/business owners are twofold. The primary focus is to provide users with information about London Premier League football grounds and encourage them to book official tours to the grounds. The second aim is to work towards creating and expanding a business by impressing the value of the website on football club business operatives, encouraging future partnerships to promote and sell their tours.

2.  **Site Users** - the main focus of the site will be to provide information to users about London Premier League football grounds. It is anticipated that the vast majority of users will already have some interest in football. However, there will be other users with little previous interest in the game who would find the site useful e.g. visitors to London. Either way, it is expected that most users would rely on mobile devices to view the website. I am drawing on the experience of myself and friends as followers of football and users of football related sites to create the user goals for this site.
  

### Project Strategy
---
-  #### Site Owner/Business Goals

	* As the site owner, I want features and content that will engage new users quickly, encourage them to explore the site and draw them back in the future.

	* As the site owner, I want users to be able to interact with the site and easily find the information that interests them.
	
	* As the site owner, I want to provide users with useful information without overloading them.

	* As the site owner, I want the site to be accessible to all users.
	
	* As the site owner, I want to demonstrate the value of the site to potential business partners.

  

-  #### User Goals (general)

	* As a user, I want to be immediately drawn into the site and understand its main purpose.

	* As a user, I want to be able to easily identify what I need and navigate the site to get to it.

	* As a user, I want concise but informative content, displayed in an aesthetic and appealing manner.

	* As a user, I want to be able to view the site clearly and intuitively on different device sizes.

	* As a user, I expect the site to be fully accessible.

-  #### User Stories (customer users)

	* As a new visitor, I want to be quickly reassured that this site will be of interest to me.

	* As a new visitor, I want to be able to identify the content of the site and be able to easily navigate to areas of interest e.g. can I visit the stadiums?
	
	* As a new visitor, I would like to know where the stadiums are located. 
	
	* As a new or returning visitor, I would like to be able to interact with the site so that I can easily display only the information on the stadiums that are of interest to me.

	* As a frequent visitor, I would like to be able to access further information on the site content, share my experiences and connect with other users of the site.


### Project Scope

---

Looking at the User and Owner/Business Goals, there are plenty of features and content which could be included in the site to attempt to satisfy all their needs. However, a number of factors limit what would be possible or desirable to include in the first development stage.

The main constraints are time and the current technological expertise of the developer. The decisions made at this stage are designed to avoid making the scope too large, such that the project becomes overloaded and fails to meet deadlines or making it too small, such that there is an unimpressive end result.

The first development stage aims to create a Minimal Viable Product, providing users with the core requirements that they actually need. Additional features can be added at future developmental stages, once feedback has been received from the initial site features.  

The features to include in this first development stage will be determined by creating a strategy trade-off table, drawing on the user goals and needs.

 #### Strategy Trade-offs

 Opportunity | Importance | Viability
----------- | ---------- | ---------
Clear and intuitive navigational links | 5 | 5
Interactive map displaying locations | 5 | 5
User-controlled display of information on each stadium | 5 | 5 
Functioning additional information form for users | 5 | 5
Responsive for all device sizes | 5 | 5
Social media links | 4 | 5
Facilities around the stadiums | 4 | 3
Direct ticket booking system | 4 | 1
Individual pages for each stadium | 3 | 3

The higher feasibility elements will be incorporated in this first stage of development.
